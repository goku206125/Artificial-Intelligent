1. Run the program.
2. You will be asked for a series of inputs for the parameters (a range of their acceptable values will be stated). You can test multiple sets of parameters at once
   by typing in multiple values for a parameter separated by spaces. If you vary more than one parameter, every combination of parameters you input will be tested.
3. Enter the number of trials you want to run for each set of parameters. This is an option since the final value produced can vary considerably for the same set of
   parameters. Having more trials will lengthen the computation time significantly, but it will allow for a more reliable analysis on the effects of each parameter.
   If more than one trial is selected, the graphs printed will show the best individuals for all trials concurrently for the current set of parameters concurrently.
   to show the consistency of the algorith with those parameters.
4. Enter the output mode. This offers the option to save calculated values in a txt file and to avoid printing graphs (if a purely numerical analysis is desired).
5. The algorithm will run for every combination of parameters inputted. If the option to show graphs is chosen, each graph must be closed for the next one to be
   generated. A series of numerical values will also be printed. The most important ones are "Best individual: mean" and "Best solution: mean" (the 'mean' means that
   the average across all trials is taken). The other values are mainly there for deeper analysis.\
6. The program can be run again with different parameters after the current set of parameters has been tested,
